# Full Stack Contact App


## A contact application with CRUD functionalities and implemented in React.Js, Node.Js and Express.Js. I used MongoDB as a non-relational database .


### For installing the app and running on your machine, one will have to start backend-server and client-side server seperately. 

```
$ cd fullstack-contact-app/client
$ npm run start

$ cd fullstack-contact-app/server
$ npm run server
```
